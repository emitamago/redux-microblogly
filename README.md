# About this project
this is part of rithm school project on Redux and React
Backend of this app was provided by school and our task was to build frontend usisng redux and react

# How to run test
At backned root directry, please run `npm test`

# Callenges
Exercise was structured to start design react state where we did not know structure of data backend api response.
we then move the react state to redux. After finishing redux state, we finally got to see backend api's data.
Because how it's structured, We have to do quite refactoring on our redux state.

It taught us greate deal of real world development. No matter how you carefully design your code, unexpected change in other part of codebase will always occur and it is our tast to quickly adapt and refactor according to the changes. And at same time, it will be so much efficient to design code in the way which can adapt changes to begin with.

Also, it taught us importance to see and understand whole project data flow when I designed even small part of codebase to
avoid any possilbe unnecessary refactoring.
